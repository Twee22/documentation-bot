## 5. Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with the server (these are rare).

## 6. Rate Limiting

The API allows for up to 5000 requests per hour. Once this limit has been reached, all requests will respond with a 429 status code until the limit resets at the start of the next hour.

## 7. SDK Examples

Currently, there are no SDKs available for this API. However, you can easily use it with any HTTP client library in your favorite language.
