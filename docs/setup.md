# Setup Documentation

## 1. Prerequisites and System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A system running Linux, macOS, or Windows.
- Python 3.6 or later installed.
- pip (Python package installer) installed.
- Virtualenv installed. This is optional but recommended to avoid conflicts between Python packages.
- Git installed to clone the repository.
- Access to a terminal or command line interface.

## 2. Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install the project:

1. Open your terminal or command line interface.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd project
   ```
4. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it. On macOS and Linux:
   ```
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```
   py -m venv env
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```
5. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Run the setup file:
   ```
   python setup.py install
   ```

## 3. Configuration Setup

1. Copy the example environment variables file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and replace the placeholder values with your actual values.

## 4. Environment Variables

The `.env` file contains the following environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: The URL of your database.
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for your application. This should be a random string of characters.

## 5. Database Setup

This section is applicable if your project uses a database.

1. Create a new database in your database management system.

2. Replace the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file with the URL of your new database.

## 6. Testing the Installation

To test the installation, run the project's tests:

```
python -m unittest
```

If the tests pass, the installation was successful.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- If you get a "permission denied" error when running `pip install -r requirements.txt`, try running the command with `sudo`: `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- If you get an error that a package is not found, try installing it manually with `pip install package-name`.

- If you get a "command not found" error when trying to activate the virtual environment, make sure you have Virtualenv installed. If you do, try using the full path to the `activate` script in the command.

- If you get a database connection error, make sure your `DATABASE_URL` is correct and that your database server is running.
